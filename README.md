# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Optimal velocity and safety of discontinuous conduction through the heterogeneous Purkinje-ventricular junction.**   
Aslanidi OV, Stewart P, Boyett MR, Zhang H. _Biophys J_ 2009 Jul 8;97(1):20-39
[19580741](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19580741) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Slow and discontinuous wave conduction through nonuniform junctions in cardiac
tissues is generally considered unsafe and proarrythmogenic. However, the
relationships between tissue structure, wave conduction velocity, and safety
at such junctions are unknown. We have developed a structurally and
electrophysiologically detailed model of the canine Purkinje-ventricular
junction (PVJ) and varied its heterogeneity parameters to determine such
relationships. We show that neither very fast nor very slow conduction is
safe, and there exists an optimal velocity that provides the maximum safety
factor for conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time
delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and
morphological differences between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular tissue.
The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite
the adjacent ventricular tissue, but is not long enough for the source-to-load
mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time. The observed relationships
between the conduction velocity and safety factor can provide new insights
into optimal conditions for wave propagation through nonuniform junctions
between various cardiac tissues.
